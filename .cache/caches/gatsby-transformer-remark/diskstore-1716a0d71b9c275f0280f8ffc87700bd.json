Well that would\nbe another story to tell.</p>\n<p>Back then I was working mostly in backend using <a href=\"https://coffeescript.org/\">CoffeeScript</a>\n(I know ðŸ™ˆ). VS Code had a little support for CoffeeScript so I didn't had any\nproblems using vim full time.</p>\n<p>But things changed drastically when I moved into UI development this year. I had\nto spend hours reading blogs, threads on reddit to create at least a workable\nsetup for a hassle-less React enviornment. Here I am sharing my setup and stuffs\nthat still don't work.</p>\n<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>\n<p>Out of the box vim/nvim supports syntax highlighting for major programming\nlanguages.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">ls</span> /usr/share/vim/vim80/syntax/</code></pre></div>\n<p>But It is yet to add <code class=\"language-text\">jsx</code> to its inventory. Also there are some javascript\nspecific plugins that makes syntax highlighting much better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mxw/vim-jsx\">vim-jsx</a> is by far the best jsx plugin for vim.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript\">vim-javascript</a> provides better\nsyntax highlighting and code folding support compared to the default one.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"vim\"><pre class=\"language-vim\"><code class=\"language-vim\">Plugin <span class=\"token string\">'mxw/vim-jsx'</span>\nPlugin <span class=\"token string\">'pangloss/vim-javascript'</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3>Linters and Formatters</h3>\n<p>Well everyone has a love hate relationship with linters. Nobody likes those\nannoying red lines on the editor the moment they add a newline.</p>\n<p>But with vim You are in luck. <a href=\"https://github.com/w0rp/ale\">ALE</a> is a nice\nplugin that asynchronously checks for syntatical error in the code. It supports\nmnay language specific linters and formatters.</p>"}
