Proxy servers are pretty  common in college and business type institutions.</p>\n<p>You can locate your proxy settings from your browser's settings panel.</p>\n<h2>Using Proxy with NPM</h2>\n<p>Once you have obtained the proxy settings (server URL, port, username and password); you need to configure your npm configurations as follows.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ npm config set proxy http://&#x3C;username>:&#x3C;password>@&#x3C;proxy-server-url>:&#x3C;port>\n$ npm config set https-proxy http://&#x3C;username>:&#x3C;password>@&#x3C;proxy-server-url>:&#x3C;port>\n</code></pre>\n<p>You would have to replace <code>&#x3C;username></code>, <code>&#x3C;password></code>, <code>&#x3C;proxy-server-url></code>, <code>&#x3C;port></code> with the values specific to your proxy server credentials.</p>\n<p>These fields are optional. For instance, your proxy server might not even require <code>&#x3C;username></code> and <code>&#x3C;password></code>, or that it might be running on port 80 (in which case <code>&#x3C;port></code> is not required).</p>\n<p>Once you have set these, your npm install, <code>npm i -g etc</code>. would work properly.</p>"}
