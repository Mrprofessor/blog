Well as usual I don't have a resolution this year. My resolution deadlines are quite small and always ends with utter disappointment, so I better not mention it here.(recruiters ignore this)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let's get serious!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><strong>New project</strong></h3>\n<p>In January, I started working on a project named <strong>Solitude</strong>. It's a note taking application which is using GitHub as a CMS. It will create and maintain a repository of notes and will sync them in real-time. The design is inspired from <a href=\"https://utteranc.es/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">utteranc.es</a> which uses GitHub issues to store blog comments. This website uses Utterances too.</p>\n<p>Solitude aims to be a very opinionated and self-controlled note taking application. Hence the contents of the solitude-maintained repository should only be modified by the application in order to maintain a stable state.</p>\n<p>I am using React, Redux and GitHub's graphQL API to build this application. Also using <a href=\"https://codemirror.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Codemirror</a> as the note taking editor.</p>\n<p>The hardest part building this application is to rememeber technologies that I haven't used in almost an year.</p>\n<p>New project ideas</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A micro server to authenticate GitHub</li>\n<li>Minimal static site generator</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I will be using python to build both the projects.</p>\n<h3><strong>New languages</strong></h3>\n<p>I have been writting Javascript and Python for the pase 4 years and I have always believed that these two are enough to satisfy all my needs as web developer. Then I came accross a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OyfBQmvr2Hc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talk</a> and I decided that I gotta learn LISP.</p>\n<p>Also I am thinking to switching to Emacs. Already joined their camp on reddit.</p>\n<p>P.S: Unedited and raw stuff</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 31, 2020","path":"/log/status-update-2","title":"Status update #2"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
