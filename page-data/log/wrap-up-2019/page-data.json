These are listed in no particular order.</p>\n<h3><strong>Python</strong></h3>\n<p>In June I switched my job and accepted a position of back-end developer in a fairly new company and a brand new project. The tech stack was python and angular. Even though Python was my first love, by that time I was more of a JS guy rather than a Pythonista. Luckily I got more than enough support from my team to understand the implemented code base and in no time I was comfortable enough complete several Jira tasks.</p>\n<p>I have learned Flask as it was the <em>de facto</em> framework for all the projects we have been building here. I couldn't help but notice how similar it was to express.js, which in fact helped in my acclerated learning.</p>\n<p>Python is so straight forward, sometimes it let me wonder why I left it in the first place.</p>\n<h3><strong>React</strong></h3>\n<p>Even though I have been building React applications for more than two years, This year, particularly the first half in <a href=\"https://turbot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Turbot</a> I got an opportunity to really build/contribute to a project which helped me understand the design patterns around a front-end application, code-spliting, authorization, authentication and much more.</p>\n<h3><strong>Touch typing</strong></h3>\n<p>This is something I am actually proud of.</p>\n<p>Fortunately I was able to get a job that respects the work life balance everybody should have. Ironically given the fact that I had little difference between work and my life(my cat sighs), I chose to develop some nerd powers that I have been dreaming to have for a long time.\nI have always wanted to learn touch typing since I saw one of my ex-colleague writing code at 80wpm.</p>\n<p>I never actually got time to practice/focus on it until after June, when I changed my job and joined the above mentioned company. The project was in its infancy and all I had to do is write code without looking down at my keyboard. I will admit, it was really tough to break an ancient practice of peeking and typing until I replaced my keyboard keycaps with blank ones.</p>\n<p>Also <a href=\"https://10fastfingers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">10fastfingers.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.typingclub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">typingclub</a> were a great help in practicing too.</p>\n<h3><strong>vi</strong></h3>\n<p>This year was monumental for my personal vim experience.</p>\n<p>My vim configuration got much matured. Coupling with touch-typing I almost felt like a Wizard I always wanted to be. I even wrote some posts on customizing vim for different purposes too.</p>\n<p>Pretty good huh!</p>\n<h3><strong>epilogue</strong></h3>\n<p>Honestly it was a pretty good year for me. A new job, new city and a bunch of cool stuff to learn!</p>\n<div class=\"post-image\">\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/32d15f5774ac0d0f9026114cfd4acd45/c2b56/loki.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 80.39021164021165%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"loki\" title=\"loki\" src=\"/static/32d15f5774ac0d0f9026114cfd4acd45/c35de/loki.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/32d15f5774ac0d0f9026114cfd4acd45/afcd2/loki.jpg 300w,\n/static/32d15f5774ac0d0f9026114cfd4acd45/82472/loki.jpg 600w,\n/static/32d15f5774ac0d0f9026114cfd4acd45/c35de/loki.jpg 1200w,\n/static/32d15f5774ac0d0f9026114cfd4acd45/98235/loki.jpg 1800w,\n/static/32d15f5774ac0d0f9026114cfd4acd45/d7d8f/loki.jpg 2400w,\n/static/32d15f5774ac0d0f9026114cfd4acd45/c2b56/loki.jpg 3024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n</div>\n<p>Hope Loki approves this post.</p>\n<p>I got him this year too.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 31, 2019","path":"/log/wrap-up-2019","title":"Wrap up 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
