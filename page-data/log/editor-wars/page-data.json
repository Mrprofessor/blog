This is about my own battle\nfor choosing and selling myself a single one true editor(not Emacs).</p>\n<h3>Journey so far</h3>\n<p>As far as I can remember, I wrote my first program in turbo c like most other\nIndian computer students. Of course before that I have used MS word, but here\nwe are talking about real editor folks. I do remember using eclipse, code blocks,\nand visual studio during my initial college days. I barely wrote any code in those\ndays but I have always loved to tinker with those cool tools. Those were the best\nat that time.</p>\n<p>I had heard about vim from a friend who was kinda a linux freak and didn't care\ntoo much about it. Linux was never my jam as I had only one laptop and the single\npurpose of that device is to play games. For first two years of my graduation\nI ignored vim.</p>\n<!--TODO-->\n<p>Somehow in my 6th semester I chose a project which seemed pretty daunting at that\ntime. It was LFS(LINK PLEASE). Linux from scratch.</p>\n<p>Then suddenly I learned about Red Hat and studied for it's basic administrator\ncertification where I had to use vi. There was simply no option.</p>\n<p>blah blah blah</p>\n<p>P.S: Unedited and raw stuff</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 19, 2019","path":"/log/editor-wars","title":"Editor wars"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
