## about

I build large and scalable web applications at work. I dream of building tiny and useful applications at home.

I can probably free up some hours in a week for software consulting if I like your idea and most importantly you. You can even hire me full-time if you are shipping applications with a [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) license.

Do drop a comment instead of sending me e-mails if you need any help regarding any of my articles.

Thanks for showing interest. Go away now. Bye!
